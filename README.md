# Custom to-do list: in progress

I chose to build this because I needed a better way to organize my projects and to-do items. I know there are a *ton* of free apps out there but you can't really customize them to *my* liking. Plus, I know this is a common 'beginner' project, so I knew it'd be pretty straightforward to build. 

I chose to use **PHP/SQL** as a back-end, because, well, it's the only back-end I know of. I don't know it super well though, so this is good practice.

# A note on working with JS & PHP

The funny thing I realized is that you can use Javascript (namely jQuery) for the *animations* of removing an item, but you also need to use AJAX to transmit the data (in this case, usually the ID of the todo item) to the php logic which actually submits the form to the database.

# Where I wanna go with this

A to-do list for a to-do list? Heck yeah.

- Make a way to 'uncomplete' items marked 'completed' by mistake.
- Show 'Completed' separately or at the bottom.
- Interact with the item in some way to view/edit/create a description attached to that item.
- The ability to drag and drop to rearrange categories.
- The ability to 'pin' an item to the top of a category.
- Make it easy to change/customize the style.
